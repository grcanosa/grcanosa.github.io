After receiving my brand new XPS-13 with Ubuntu 16.04 the first thing I
noticed is that the palm rejection feature is not present at all. 

I will try to describe as best as I can the methods I have tried and whether or not they
were successful.

### libinput

I tried was was suggested [here](#https://www.reddit.com/r/Dell/comments/4pgek1/dell_xps_13_touch_pad_palm_detection_on_ubuntu/) and installed:

```
sudo apt-get install xserver-xorg-input-libinput
```

Then I edited the file */usr/share/X11/xor:g.conf.d/90-libinput.conf* so that it contained this:
```
Section "InputClass"
        Identifier "libinput touchpad catchall"
        MatchIsTouchpad "on"
        MatchDevicePath "/dev/input/event*"
        Driver "libinput"
        Option "Tapping" "True"
        Option "PalmDetection" "True"
        Option "TappingDragLock" "True"
EndSection
```

This method was not succesful at first. A little tweak was needed. If you
list your */usr/share/X11/xor:g.conf.d/* directory you may have a
*51-synaptis.conf* file. That file takes precedece over the libinput one
that was just created. To solve this problem make a symlink with a smaller
number:

```
sudo ln -s /usr/share/X11/xor:g.conf.d/90-libinput.conf
/usr/share/X11/xor:g.conf.d/40-libinput.conf
```
