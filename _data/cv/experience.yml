      description: I was the main developer of an open-source high-performance C++ implementation of the RTPS (Real-Time Publish Subscription) standard of the OMG (www.omg.org). This protocol was designed to manage communications in publish-subscribe frameworks. I also contributed to the writing of the proposal of European Projects. I received a Torres-Quevedo grant from the European Social Funds. I also generated different GUI-applications using the Fast RTPS product I developed.
